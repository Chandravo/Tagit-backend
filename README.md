Most people attach their name and phone number to their luggage, so if it gets lost, the Finder
can contact them, and they can retrieve the package. But, In the digital age, we must protect
our privacy, and writing a phone number on luggage can expose you to fraud, spam
messages, etc. So, this software’s goal is to protect the user's privacy and provide the user
with the ability to locate Lost luggage without providing private information. This is achieved
by creating a Unique QR code for every User. When the QR code has been scanned, the
location will be sent to the User via email. If lost, they can check the time and location where
and when the QR was scanned. The finder contacts the user using the live chat feature in the
software itself. They also share their respective location to retrieve the luggage.
By contacting only through the website, the user’s privacy is protected, and they can
regenerate the QR code if required.
Users can also order QR stickers in different sizes from the website itself. Users can reach us
from the website if they have questions or suggestions.
